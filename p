Here’s how each epic aligns with the five-point prioritization framework you provided.
I’ve chosen the single most-relevant driver for every epic, based on its stated purpose and expected outcomes.

Epic (Priority ID)	Brief Purpose (what it delivers)	Dominant Prioritization Criterion	Rationale

P1 – Service Recovery Analytics for Medicare Channels	Deeper analytics to surface and remediate negative service experiences.	5 · Member experience	Directly targets satisfaction by diagnosing service pain-points and guiding improvements.
P2 – Repeat Caller Analysis & Resolution Strategy	Identify and reduce repeat contacts within six months.	5 · Member experience	Cuts frustration, boosts first-call resolution, and lowers repeat volume.
P3 – Self-Service Medicare Call Log Report for Compliance	On-demand ODAG/CDAG call-log access for audits.	1 · Government / Legal	Enables timely regulatory audits—an explicit compliance requirement.
P4 – Grievance Scrub Reporting for External Vendor Oversight	Standardized reporting to monitor outsourced grievance scrubbing.	1 · Government / Legal	Ensures continued compliance in a vendor-managed process.
P5 – CS→Claims Appeal Adjustment Pends Reporting	Daily report of claim-appeal pends to speed resolutions.	1 · Government / Legal	Triggered by a DMHC finding; compliance remediation is central.

P9 – Verint Reporting Expansion on Quality & DPA	Enhance call-quality / voice analytics for coaching.	5 · Member experience	Better agent performance → higher service quality for members.
P10 – Facets Inventory Reporting Enhancements	Automate critical inventory visibility in Facets.	2 · Operational support	Essential “keep-the-lights-on” reporting for day-to-day operations.
P11 – Pega Use-Case Reporting for Captured Interactions	Provide visibility into Pega-logged processes/interactions.	2 · Operational support	Improves oversight & effectiveness of a core workflow platform.

How to use this table

In Jira (or your tracker) you can paste the Criterion into a custom “Priority Driver” field for quick filtering.

If an epic later gains a secondary driver (e.g., cost savings + member experience), you can tag it with multiple labels while keeping the dominant one as its primary criterion.


Let me know if you need this exported to Excel/CSV or merged into your existing epic register!
