✅ Jira Story 2: Create Calculated Fields on Dashboard

Summary: Add calculated fields for dashboard enhancements

Description / Comment:

> I have added the following calculated fields in the dashboard for metric computation:

% of Exempt Grievance Cases:


COUNTD(IF [CATG_DESC] = "Exempt Grievance" THEN [ISSC_ID] END) / COUNTD([ISSC_ID])

% of Grievance-Exempt Subjects:


COUNTD(IF [SUBJ_DRSC] = "Grievance-Exempt" THEN [ISSC_ID] END) / COUNTD([ISSC_ID])

Overlap Count (Both Subject and Category are Exempt):


COUNTD(IF [SUBJ_DRSC] = "Grievance-Exempt" AND [CATG_DESC] = "Exempt Grievance" THEN [ISSC_ID] END)
