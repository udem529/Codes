Below is the breakdown and the formulas for each calculated field based on the logic you described:


---

‚úÖ 1. Subject is Grievance Exempt

COUNTD(IF [SUBJ_DRSC] = "Grievance-Exempt" THEN [ISSC_ID] END)


---

‚úÖ 2. Category is Exempt Grievance

COUNTD(IF [CATG_DESC] = "Exempt Grievance" THEN [ISSC_ID] END)


---

‚úÖ 3. Subject = Grievance-Exempt BUT Category ‚â† Exempt Grievance

COUNTD(
  IF [SUBJ_DRSC] = "Grievance-Exempt" AND [CATG_DESC] != "Exempt Grievance"
  THEN [ISSC_ID] END
)


---

‚úÖ 4. Category = Exempt Grievance BUT Subject ‚â† Grievance-Exempt

COUNTD(
  IF [CATG_DESC] = "Exempt Grievance" AND [SUBJ_DRSC] != "Grievance-Exempt"
  THEN [ISSC_ID] END
)


---

‚úÖ 5. Both Convey Same (i.e., Both Match)

COUNTD(
  IF [SUBJ_DRSC] = "Grievance-Exempt" AND [CATG_DESC] = "Exempt Grievance"
  THEN [ISSC_ID] END
)
